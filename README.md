# Student-Stress-Level-Predictors

- The purpose of this project was to predict stress levels in students based on multiple factors in 5 different categories (Psychological, Physiological, Environmental, Academic and Social). 
    
  - This project highlights the following approaches:
    
    - Identifying a dataset to work with
    - Cleaning the data
    - Performing EDA
    - Performing Feature Engineering
    - Scaling of Numerical Data
    - Encoding Categorical Data
    - Running multiple iterations of Random Forest and KNN models, which includes hyperparameter tuning, adjustments of the training/test set ratio and adjustments of features
    - Creating visualizations of the data to tell the story of how our best model performed
